  {
    question: "How long does a 3D render take?",
    answer: "It depends on the complexity of the project. A single interior or exterior render typically takes 3–5 business days. Larger projects with multiple views or animations are discussed and agreed upon upfront so you always know what to expect.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a 3D render cost?",
    answer: "Every project is unique, so we provide a custom quote based on your specific needs — number of views, complexity, and timeline. Contact us for a free, no-obligation quote and we'll get back to you within 24 hours.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do I need to provide to get started?",
    answer: "We work with whatever you have — architectural plans, sketches, reference images, or even a rough idea. The more detail you can share, the better. We'll guide you through the process from day one.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many revisions are included?",
    answer: "Every project includes up to 3 rounds of revisions. We work closely with you throughout the process to make sure the final result matches your vision perfectly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with clients outside Cyprus?",
    answer: "Yes — we serve clients across Cyprus and Greece, and we work remotely with ease. All communication, file sharing, and approvals happen online so location is never a barrier.",
  },
  {
    question: "What software do you use?",
    answer: "We use SketchUp for 3D modeling and D5 Render for photorealistic rendering. This combination allows us to produce high-quality, realistic images efficiently and with great attention to detail.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help sell a property that hasn't been built yet?",
    answer: "Absolutely — this is one of our most popular services. Photorealistic renders allow real estate developers and agents to market and sell off-plan properties before construction begins, giving buyers a clear and compelling vision of the finished project.",
